# Greenhouse-Monitoring-Controlling-System

The purpose of our project was to make an arduino based autonomous system which could control a mini greenhouse. The arduino was programmed to switch the appliances on and off based on temperature, soil moisture, light intensity, and humidity measurements. Also there was an LED display for showing the parameter values. We also used GSM module to keep information saved and updated.
